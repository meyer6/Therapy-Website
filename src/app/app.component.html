After years of knowing I wanted to help people but HR and recruitment not quite fulfilling me, I had FINALLY found what I was meant to do in life.\<br>Two weeks later I started my Transformational Coaching Diploma with the Animas Centre for Coaching.\<br>\<br>In April 2022 I went full time with my Coaching and Hypnotherapy business and itâ€™s hard to describe how proud and fulfilled I feel! Every client I have, every comment on social media I receive, every testimonial I read, my heart is so full with happiness, \<b>seeing people achieve their dreams, feel happier and not let their mind limit them.\</b>'"
